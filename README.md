Hey folks at MapQuest.  Here's a brief overview about why this might look a
little different and I wanted to explain.

Every AngularJS project I've worked
on either was already built and was added to or started from angular-seed
project: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed

To me it makes the most sense to use what's already there and build upon it
so that's why I went this route because it's what I would have done in the real
world.

There's instructions on the angular-seed github but basically run 'npm-install'
in the root angular-test directory, once that's done run 'npm start' which will
run the server then go to localhost:8000/app in the browser and it should load.

I would have liked to use bootstrap or some other framework for doing nice
layouts and stylesheets but I just ran out of time and wanted to make sure
the functionality was working first.  Plus, that's what designers are for :).

Another fix I would like to have done but ran out of time for was some better
caching; right now it's basically reloading the images each time you go to
the same city, so it would be nice to not have to do that.  Either way I hope
you guys enjoy critiquing my code!

If there's any issues or questions please let me know if I need to clarify
anything.

Thanks,
