Hey folks at MapQuest.  Here's a brief overview about why this might look a
little different and I wanted to explain.

Every AngularJS project I've worked
on either was already built and was added to or started from angular-seed
project: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed

To me it makes the most sense to use what's already there and build upon it
so that's why I went this route because it's what I would have done in the real
world.

There's instructions on the angular-seed github but basically run 'npm-install'
in the root angular-test directory, once that's done run 'npm start' which will
run the server then go to localhost:8000/app in the browser and it should load.

If there's any issues or questions please let me know if I need to clarify
anything.

Thanks,
John Flaherty
